<h1 align='center'>Toast Notification</h1>
In this toast notification, there are four buttons on the webpage, and when a user clicks on one of them (e.g., “success,” “error,” or “info”), the relevant toast notification will pop up from the top right corner.
The toast will automatically disappear after five seconds, or the user can hide it by clicking on the close icon. To make the toast more visually appealing, I’ve added a progress line at the bottom of each toast.
